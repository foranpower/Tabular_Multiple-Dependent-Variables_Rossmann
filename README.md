The goal is to transform the Rossmann Data set to multiple dependent varibles. That will be one for each store's sales.

Original Data Source: Kaggle's Rossmann competition.

Cleaned data source: fastai -> course-v3 -> nbs -> dl1 -> rossmann_data_clean.ipynb

Then, I simply changed them from pickles to csv for excel.
